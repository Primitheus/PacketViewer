# PacketViewer
Simple Packet Viewer
Developing this to help with Reverse Engineering/Server Emulation Projects.

Input Packets in the format: 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 (etc)

TODO:
 - Theme Customisations
 - Create/Import Profiles for header data analysis
 - Import/Export Packets using CSV & other formats similar to Wireshark

Planning some more features to help automate analysis of packet data.
